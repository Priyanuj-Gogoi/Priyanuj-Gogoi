### About Me

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Priyanuj Gogoi**, a 19 y/o Back-End Developer from India.
Although, I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor degree in Commerce, but my true passion lies in programming.

### How I Got Into Programming?

I began my journey into the world of programming during my 11th grade (2020).
Initially, I struggled to grasp the concepts of **C++**, which was introduced as part of my college's Computer Science curriculum.
However, I didn't let this discourage me. Determined to overcome the challenges, I delved into the subject, dedicating countless hours to understanding the intricacies of the language.

As time went on, I realized that programming wasn't just a requirement for my studies; it had become a hobby and a true passion. Eager to expand my knowledge and skills, I embarked on a self-taught journey through online resources and documentation. This led me to explore other languages such as **JavaScript** and **Dart**, further broadening my programming horizons.

### What I Do Besides Programming?

Besides programming, I love to play Chess and as an avid gamer, immersing myself
into titles like League of Legends, Genshin Impact, Final Fantasy etc.
Moreover, I'm also an enthusiastic fan of anime and web series.
